<h1 align='center'>

  Hi there, I'm <a href="https://github.com/marco1991orlando/" target="_blank">@MarcoOrlando</a> ðŸ‘‹

</h1>





  <p>

I'm a Computational biologist with lab skills, working since > 8 years in the characterization of novel proteins/enzymes and in studying function-structure interconnection during molecular evolution. I am skilled at integrating wet-lab and computational methods. Now I am becoming a Protein Designer working with custom workflows that integrate AI- and physics-based methods for developing binders to medically relevant biomarkers, both folded and unfolded. 

I want to drive innovation in protein and biocatalyst discovery/evolution/engineering for industrial and biomedical applications.

In my opinion any future development in the biotech field will need self-improving transfer learning/reinforcement learning AI-approaches that can be supervised to efficiently build new models/new hypothesis, as well as to autonomously propose experiments for collecting new experimental data. I hope with my feedbacks and work to contribute in building this future of supervised automation in bioinformatics.

  </p>
